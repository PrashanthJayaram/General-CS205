Linux was originally developed as a free operating system for personal computers based on the Intel x86 architecture, but has since been ported to more computer hardware platforms than any other operating system.[18] Because of the dominance of Android on smartphones, Linux has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.[19] Linux is also the leading operating system on servers and other big iron systems such as mainframe computers and virtually all fastest supercomputers,[20][21] but is used on only around 2.3% of desktop computers[22][23] when not including Chrome OS, which has about 5% of the overall and nearly 20% of the sub-$300 notebook sales.[24] Linux also runs on embedded systems, which are devices whose operating system is typically built into the firmware and is highly tailored to the system; this includes smartphones and tablet computers running Android and other Linux derivatives,[25] TiVo and similar DVR devices, network routers, facility automation controls, televisions,[26][27] video game consoles and smartwatches.[28]
